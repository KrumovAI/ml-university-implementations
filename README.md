# Machine Learning University Implementations

Machine Learning models I've implemented for university courses

**Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree** and **K-Means** have been implemented in class for a course called ***Stochastic Algorithms in Machine Learning*** and are based on [this repository](https://github.com/curiousily/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch) by [curiousily](https://github.com/curiousily).

**Random Forest** was the final course project for the same course.

**Q-Learning** was a final course project done for a course called ***Agent Systems***.
